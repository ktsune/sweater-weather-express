# Sweater Weather Express

Sweater Weather Express re-writes the Sweater Weather project originally done in Ruby & Rails to a Node project using Express. You can find the repo for the original Ruby project here: https://github.com/ktsune/sweater-weather

#### You can also view the project board here:
https://github.com/ktsune/sweater-weather-express/projects/1

## Visit my app on Heroku
https://limitless-lowlands-17860.herokuapp.com/

## Initial Setup
1) Clone the repo:
- $ git clone git@github.com:ktsune/express_sweater_weather.git

2) Install npm:
- $ npm install

3) Update your config/config.json file:
- Change the username fields for test, development, and production environments to your own postgres username

4) Set up the database:
- $ npx sequelize db:create (need to change username in config.json?)
- $ npx sequelize db:migrate
- $ npx sequelize db:seed:all

5) Add a .env file to your root directory to save your API keys in

- **Note, you will need your own Google Geocoding & Dark Sky API keys for the external API's in this project**

6) Here is the format they should be in in your .env file:

```
GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY=<YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API KEY>
DARK_SKY_API_KEY=<YOUR DARK SKY API KEY>
```

## How to use

  1) Once you have them stored in a .env file (step 5 above), you can access your API keys using this format:

    process.env.GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY
    process.env.DARK_SKY_API_KEY
